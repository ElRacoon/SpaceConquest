# SpaceConquest
 
#### Java Project

Space Conquest is a Java project created during our final year of an IT bachelor's degree in University of Bordeaux (FR).
It's a strategy game where you are the Ambassador of the red planet and will have to conquest all planets around.


##### To run this game :
###### On Linux 
    java -jar spaceConquest.jar
###### On Windows
    TODO or click

##### Rules :
To conquest another planet you'll have to send spaceships on it using drag and drop. You also can choose the amount of spaceships sent (in %), 
using the slider below the planet.

##### To patch :
    

### Basic 
####v1.0
In this basic version, there is only one type of planet and spaceship. When spaceships are sent, there is no overlay between them, the launch is organised in several waves.
There is no collision between spaceship and planet that is not the target. Spaceships avoid others planet.
This version also managed :
- Target change
- Troops defensive movement
- Mouse and keyboard control
- Amount of spaceship sent management
- Basic Artificial Intelligence
- Save/restore a match




##### TODO for Basics :
- Save / Restore
- javadoc 
- Ecran de fin (Detection de la fin + Affichage)
### Advanced

##### v2.0 :
- 2 type of spaceships
- Graphic optimization
- Better way to select squadrons
- Explosion management


##### v2.1 :
- Sprite Spaceship
- color variation (image + filter ?)
-
-



##### DON'T FORGET :
- put in private the methods that can -> Alt + Maj + i on IntelliJ
- Check function annotation in java
- create jar at the end and check its functioning
- javadoc
