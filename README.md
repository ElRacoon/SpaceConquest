# SpaceConquest
 
#### Java Project

Space Conquest is a Java project created during our final year of an IT bachelor's degree in University of Bordeaux (FR).
It's a strategy game where you are the Ambassador of a red planet and will have to conquest all planets around.


##### To run this game :
###### On Linux 
    java -jar spaceConquest.jar
    or 
    run the main with IntellIJ or Eclipse

##### Rules :
To conquest another planet you'll have to send spaceships on it using drag and drop. You also can choose the amount of spaceships sent (in %), 
using the slider below the planet. You also can organize your troupes, moving them from one of your planet to another.

##### To patch :
